# The-Whispering-Depths
The Whispering Depths is a classic text-based Role-Playing Game (RPG) that emphasizes exploration, resource management, and turn-based combat. The project serves as a demonstration of robust object-oriented programming (OOP) principles, initially built in Python, and later translated to a responsive web interface using modern front-end technologies
